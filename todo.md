Leveraging V2 Payload Hints in Classifier Prompt
‚úÖ Your Observation: Correct and Strategically Valuable

This is a high-leverage improvement.
The analysis_hints block produced by preprocess-svc (e.g., likely_pivoted, first_column_type, maybe later contains_dates or temporal_granularity) gives semantic structure about the dataset that the model can‚Äôt infer just from column names.

Currently, you‚Äôre sending:

"HINTS:\n" + json.dumps(hinting)


That‚Äôs low-signal, high-noise ‚Äî it looks like metadata, not actionable insight to an LLM.

üí° Your Proposed Fix: Excellent and Worth Implementing

Turning this into natural language context is the right move:

analysis_hints = payload_obj.get("analysis_hints", {})
hint_text = f"Dataset is likely pivoted: {analysis_hints.get('likely_pivoted', 'unknown')}. "
hint_text += f"The first column appears to be a: {analysis_hints.get('first_column_type', 'unknown')}."


Then inserting it into the prompt like:

prompt = f"""
DATA SCHEMA:
{schema_snippet}

ANALYSIS HINTS:
{hint_text}

USER QUESTION:
{question}
"""


‚úÖ This boosts clarity.
‚úÖ It improves model grounding.
‚úÖ It makes the classifier more ‚Äúdataset-aware‚Äù before tool selection.

‚ö†Ô∏è Refinement ‚Äî Weighted Natural Language Format

Instead of short sentences, use a bullet-style analysis summary in the classifier prompt. Gemini (and most LLMs) handle that better for reasoning.

Example:

hint_text = "\n".join([
    "DATASET INSIGHTS:",
    f"- Dataset is likely pivoted: {hints.get('likely_pivoted', 'unknown')}",
    f"- First column type: {hints.get('first_column_type', 'unknown')}",
    f"- Contains temporal fields: {hints.get('contains_temporal', 'unknown')}",
    f"- Detected numeric columns: {', '.join(hints.get('numeric_columns', [])[:5]) or 'none'}"
])


Then embed in your classifier prompt just before the question.
That gives the model a scannable, structured grounding context instead of narrative text.

‚öôÔ∏è Further Optimization ‚Äî Future-Proofing

Add a new function in gemini_client.py:

def build_classifier_context(schema_snippet, analysis_hints):
    """Formats schema and hints into a structured prompt block."""
    hint_lines = [
        f"- Likely pivoted: {analysis_hints.get('likely_pivoted', 'unknown')}",
        f"- First column type: {analysis_hints.get('first_column_type', 'unknown')}",
        f"- Contains dates: {analysis_hints.get('contains_dates', 'unknown')}",
    ]
    return f"SCHEMA:\n{schema_snippet}\n\nHINTS:\n" + "\n".join(hint_lines)


This keeps your classifier prompt logic clean, and lets you easily enrich hints in future (time_granularity, missing_rate, etc.) without editing your main classifier code.

Logging + Default Summary Behavior

You should log LLM latency and fallback reason, not just the exception.
That will help you fine-tune your timeout (15s might be too high or low).

Better:

import time
summary_obj = {}
try:
    with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=1) as ex:
        start = time.time()
        fut = ex.submit(gemini_client.format_final_response, question, res_df)
        summary_obj = fut.result(timeout=15)
        elapsed = round(time.time() - start, 2)
        logging.info(f"Summarization completed in {elapsed}s")
except TimeoutError:
    logging.warning("Summarization timed out after 15s, using fallback summary.")
    summary_obj = {"summary": "Analysis complete (summary generation timed out)."}
except Exception as e:
    logging.warning(f"Summarization call failed: {e}")
    summary_obj = {"summary": "Analysis complete (summary unavailable)."}


Why this is better:

Explicitly logs the latency of Gemini summarization (useful telemetry)

Distinguishes between timeout and other failures

Prevents silent slowdowns (you‚Äôll see patterns in Cloud Logging)

Gives user a clearer fallback message

üîß Further Optimization (Optional)

If you start doing multiple summarization calls in parallel (e.g., generating both summary and insight text), consider centralizing timeout control via a small helper:

def run_with_timeout(func, *args, timeout=15, fallback=None):
    with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=1) as ex:
        fut = ex.submit(func, *args)
        try:
            return fut.result(timeout=timeout)
        except Exception:
            return fallback


This will make your LLM-bound calls (classification, summarization, reconstruction) consistent and reusable.


Missing Timeout on Summarization Call
‚úÖ Your Observation: Correct

You‚Äôre 100% right ‚Äî the call to gemini_client.format_final_response() in the fast-path section of main.py is currently synchronous and unbounded.
That‚Äôs risky because Gemini (or any LLM endpoint) can occasionally stall or hit high latency due to network load, rate limits, or backend throttling.

Since Cloud Functions and similar platforms have total runtime limits (e.g., 540s or 900s), even one hung LLM call can block the worker, waste CPU time, and degrade user experience.

üí° Your Proposed Fix: Good, but Needs One Extra Layer

Wrapping it in a ThreadPoolExecutor with a timeout is an excellent solution.
It gives you non-blocking control, clean error handling, and keeps the rest of your fast path safe.

Your snippet:

with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=1) as ex:
    fut = ex.submit(gemini_client.format_final_response, question, res_df)
    summary_obj = fut.result(timeout=15)


‚úÖ This is clean and effective.
‚úÖ It uses the same control pattern as your classifier.
‚úÖ It falls back gracefully when the summary call fails.
